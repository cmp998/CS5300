Most likely the statue was cast in 1101 and it presents the figure of Wuzhiqi, the spirit of the rivers Huai and Guo. The earliest extensive account of the legend of Wuzhiqi by Li Gongzuo (ca. 770 - 848) is translated in full. Based on a vast array of urther primary sources the author goes on to explore the cult of this demon. He demonstrates that the statue of Wuzhigi is associated with the Taoist ritual dances and that it belongs in the context of objects cast from iron that for centuries have been placed on the banks of rivers throughout China. The book is richly illustrated with photos from the region and with reproductions of objects of art and drawings found in ancient texts. 104pp, 34 illus. As new."

XX [From the inner flap]: THOUGH often labelled a Midwestern regionalist, August Derleth shows in these new poems a power and skill which extend his work far beyond any such geographic limitations. The two groups of poems in this collection may seem dissimilar at first glance, but there is a significant psychological harmony between theme The four long poems on themes from Thoreau's essays are contemplative poems of man and nature; the love poems which follow express a psychic conflict inherent in the nature-lover's passionate love for a woman. The clarity of the Thoreau poems is in contrast to the erotic symbols, the nightmare pattern and the curious allusions of the love poems, while the music of the first group is given emphasis by the designed cacophony of the second. Many critics have been generous in their praise of Derleth's poetic gift. Typical is the judgment of David Daiches, who wrote of Derleth: ""A clear eye for the American scene and a quiet limpid style that is neatly wedded to his observation. The complete absence of fuss, the sense of control, the deft, yet unspectacular, handling of imagery -- these are qualities not common in modern poetry."" The book is illustrated with wood engravings by Frank Utpatel. [Bio from Wikipedia]: August William Derleth (February 24, 1909 - July 4, 1971) was an American writer and anthologist. Though best remembered as the first book publisher of the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, and for his own contributions to the Cthulhu Mythos genre of horror, as well as his founding of the publisher Arkham House (which did much to bring supernatural fiction into print in hardcover in the US that had only been readily available in the UK), Derleth was a leading American regional writer of his day, as well as prolific in several other genres, including historical fiction, poetry, detective fiction, science fiction, and biography. A 1938 Guggenheim Fellow, Derleth considered his most serious work to be the ambitious Sac Prairie Saga, a series of fiction, historical fiction, poetry, and non-fiction naturalist works designed to memorialize life in the Wisconsin he knew. Derleth can also be considered a pioneering naturalist and conservationist in his writing."

Er steht auf der Owl-CreekBr�cke, die Schlinge um den Hals. Unter ihm str�mt das Wasser dahin, er st�rzt st�rzt zur�ck ins Leben, das an ihm in bunter Bilderfolge vorbeizieht, ihm neue Verhei�ungen vorgaukelt, bis der brutale Ruck des Stricks ihn ins schwarze Nichts zur�ckholt . . . Zwischen Wachen und Tr�umen, zwischen Grauen und Illusion spielen diese meisterhaften Erz�hlungen von Ambrose Bierce, die auch von der schrecklichen Wirklichkeit des Krieges gepr�gt sind. Nicht die erdachten Schauder des �bersinnlichen, sondern die Entsetzlichkeiten mitten im Leben und die Anatomie der seelischen Extrem-zust�nde sind sein Metier. Nur einer hat das Wesen des Schrekkens in �hnlicher Weise gesp�rt: sein Vorbild Edgar Allan Poe. Ambrose Bierce: Einer der Gro�en. Ein Unsterblicher und also ohne Grab. Er zog hochbetagt in den Krieg und hat nichts mehr geha�t als den Krieg, hat niemals besser erz�hlt als in seinen Berichten vom amerikanischen B�rgerkrieg, hat auf das Grauen des organisierten Menschenmordens mit dem Grauen seiner M�rdergeschichten geantwortet. (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung) Der Autor Ambrose Gwinnett Bierce wurde als Sohn eines Farmers 1842 in Meigs County, Ohio, geboren. Er nahm als Offizier am amerikanischen B�rgerkrieg teil und wurde sp�ter Journalist in San Francisco, England (1872-1876) und Washington (1897). Im Jahre 1913 kehrte er den USA den R�cken. Er ging nach Mexiko, um an der Revolutionsbewegung des Pancho Villa teilzunehmen, und ist dort verschollen. Werke u. a.: The Fiends Delight (1872), Nuggets and Dust (1872), Cobwebs from an Empty Skull (1874), The Dance of Death (1877), ` Tales of Soldiers and Civilians 891), Can Such Things Be?

The book is firmly bound in clean deep indigo coloured cloth, lettered in gilt to the spine, the corners and spine ends are slightly bumped and rubbed. The text block is a little toned and dusty with light marking, one or two neat pencil notes and a small bookseller's label to the front pastedown. The dust jacket is the original, and a remarkable survival, not least because the flaps are so wide that they barely fit into the book, to the extent that somebody has folded the rear flap back a centimetre or so, it is quite toned and rubbed with some minor loss, closed tears and splits, some repaired to the reverse with tape. Additionally, underneath the dust jacket is what looks to be the original tissue wrapper, which is in quite good order. Quite an early edition of Donnelly's landmark work on the subject of Atlantis, liberally illustrated, and rare in the dust jacket."

First edition.G.M. Trevelyan's copy, signed by him on the front endpaper, underlined by him throughout with occasional notes penned by him and more annotations by him on the rear endpaper and pastedown.The British historian and academic George Macaulay Trevelyan (1876-1962) was a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. Once considered one of the most widely read historians in the world, his reputation did not survive his death. Responding to claims that his Garibaldi history is said to be biased, Trevelyan wrote in his essay ""Bias in History"": ""Without bias, I should never have written them at all. For I was moved to write them by a poetical sympathy with the passions of the Italian patriots of the period, which I retrospectively shared."" Returning to Cambridge, he was Regius Professor of History from 1927 to 1943 and served as Master of Trinity College from 1940 to 1951."

Those of you who have joined me before in these cozy collections of chills and suspense know that in earlier volumes I have explored various unusual fields to bring you exciting and absorbing stories. In the past I have delved into the world of ghosts, haunts and apparitions of various types and differing degrees of spookiness. I have taken you into the shadowy world of the spies and counterspies who are so much a part of our life today. I have picked out my favorite spellbinders in sheer suspense to share with you. We have, in short, adventured into strange and colorful places together. This time, though, we stand firmly on the side of the law. This is a collection of some of my favorite detective stories. In it we shall peer over the shoulders of many of fiction's finest detectives, to track down the malefactor and set wrong to right. We will pick up clues, solve tantalizing mysteries, and unravel riddles that seem impenetrable. I believe you will find this group of stories as exciting, as engrossing, as any I have brought you. Now the game's a-foot and the chase is on! Turn the page and we'll be on our way."" - Alfred Hitchcock."

I am well aware that it is without that polish and elaboration which should always distinguish literary work. It was hurriedly written, much of it on my knee, in railroad cars, and at country hotels, in the intervals between campaign speeches. It scarcely aspires to be called a work. It is what they denominate in England a ""skit."" It is the outgrowth of the great political struggle now going on, in this year of grace, 1892, in the United States; and it is intended to explain and defend, in the thin disguise of a story, some of the new ideas put forth by the People's Party; and which concern, I sincerely believe, all the peoples of the civilized world.

The tales in this book were written all in one month twenty years ago specifically to swell the log of Weird Tales. Since that estimable and lamented magazine already had enough stories by August Derleth in its files, the byline of Stephen Grendon was used-which was not really a foolproof disguise for there were among the readers of Weird Tales some few who were familiar with my autobiographical novel, Evening in Spring, first published in 1941, and recognized the name of the narrator in that novel as the author of the stories by Stephen Grendon.

Those of you who have joined me before in these cozy collections of chills and suspense know that in earlier volumes I have explored various unusual fields to bring you exciting and absorbing stories. In the past I have delved into the world of ghosts, haunts and apparitions of various types and differing degrees of spookiness. I have taken you into the shadowy world of the spies and counterspies who are so much a part of our life today. I have picked out my favorite spellbinders in sheer suspense to share with you. We have, in short, adventured into strange and colorful places together. This time, though, we stand firmly on the side of the law. This is a collection of some of my favorite detective stories. In it we shall peer over the shoulders of many of fiction's finest detectives, to track down the malefactor and set wrong to right. We will pick up clues, solve tantalizing mysteries, and unravel riddles that seem impenetrable. I believe you will find this group of stories as exciting, as engrossing, as any I have brought you. Now the game's a-foot and the chase is on! Turn the page and we'll be on our way."" - Alfred Hitchcock."

FROM THE PUBLISHER - The single most useful and concise guide to mythology, Bulfinch's Mythology is a collection of timeless tales from around the world. Written not for scholars but for the common reader, Bulfinch's commentary is fascinating, a series of notes to himself that grew into this highly readable collection. For the Greek myths, Bulfinch drew on Ovid and Virgil, providing lively versions of the myths of Zeus and Hera, Venus and Adonis, Daphne and Apollo, and their cohorts on Mount Olympus; the love story of Pygmalion and Galatea; the legends of the Trojan War; and the epic wanderings of Ulysses and Aeneas. For the sagas of the North, he drew on Mallet's Northern Antiquities, depicting the joys of Valhalla, the furies of Thor, and the tales of Beowulf. The book also includes mythology from the East, stories of Zoroaster, Buddha, and the Hindus. This sterling collection belongs in the libary of every serious reader. inventory #37555 Very Good in Hardcover With Slightly Discolored Boards."

This is the December 1974 First Printing. Solar Pons draws thoughtfully at his pipe, his keen eyes fixed on the door to his quarters at No. 78 Praed Street. In a moment a visitor will arrive-once again setting the game afoot. When August Derleth inherited the mantle of Arthur Conan Doyle, he created in Solar Pons a detective whose genius cannot be matched-perhaps not even by Holmes himself. In these ten superbly crafted adventures, Solar Pons's deductive cunning slices through the tangles of the most bizarre episodes in his career. The tradition of deduction at its very best.

John Blackader; Compiled Chiefly From Unpublished Manuscripts, and Memoirs of His Life and Ministry Written By Himself While Prisoner on the Bass (Rock); and Containing Illustrations of The Episcopal Persecution From The Restoration To The Death Of Charles II. With An Appendix Giving a Short Account of The History and Siege of the Bass. In 1653 BLACKADDER was ordained by the Presbytery of Dumfries as minister of Troqueer, near Dumfries, during the time of the Commonwealth, when the monarchy was deposed. People came from other parishes to hear his weekly sermons. He arranged for reciprocal visits with two of his neighbouring parishes. He catechised the parish twice each year, and achieved improvements in the standards of worship and of religious knowledge. Blackadder was expelled from his parish in 1662 after the restoration of Charles II because he refused to comply with the Episcopacy, which the government had imposed in Scotland. He was arrested and taken to Edinburgh, and was released soon after and moved to Caitloch in Glencairn parish, where he sometimes preached to large assemblies. When the authorities heard about his activities, he moved again, and began a wandering life. In 1666 letters of Council were directed against Blackadder and other ministers who were preaching, praying and baptizing without authority. In 1674 Blackadder was made an outlaw, with a heavy reward for his capture, but continued to preach. In 1678 the Battle of Bothwell Bridge was fought between militant covenanters and government troops, in which the latter were victorious. Blackadder was not involved. He fled to Rotterdam (Netherlands), and returned to Scotland by June 1679. He went again to Holland in May 1680, taking his eldest son, who was to study medicine. He returned in September that year.[10] By 1681 he resumed preaching, taking Edinburgh as his base and speaking at meetings in several neighbouring parishes.[6] In his last public work, at a muir-side in the parish of Livingstone on 28 March 1681, he spoke on the text 'That the nearer our delivery, our pains and showers would come thicker and sorer upon us' (Micah 4:9). On 6 April 1681 Blackadder was arrested in Edinburgh by Major Johnston. He was tried and found guilty, and imprisoned on the Bass Rock. He was confined in a cell with three small iron-barred windows facing west. His health deteriorated due to the harsh conditions. After he fell ill in prison, the privy council gave permission for him to leave as long as he remained in Edinburgh, but he was already too ill. He died in prison at the end of 1685, aged sixty-three, and was buried in North Berwick (Scotland) churchyard. Sm.8vo. **Will be well-packed for posting/shipping**.

Pliure sur coin haut 1er plat (voir scan), autrement BON ETAT, Traduit de l'americain ( The Starmen, 1952 ) Trehearne fut surpris de constater la pr�dominance persistante de la forme humano�de, m�me lorsque les souches les plus lointaines n'avaient rien d'humain � la base. Yann lui expliqua ce qu'on enseignait aux jeunes enfants Vardde en classe de biologie g�n�rale : le d�veloppement de la forme humano�de (c'est-�-dire poss�dant une t�te reconnaissable se tenant dans une position verticale et droite, munie de deux membres inf�rieurs servant � la locomotion et de deux membres sup�rieurs capables de t�ches manuelles) �tait simplement bas� sur la n�cessit� pour une esp�ce donn�e, qui progressait sur la simple fonction animale, de se tenir debout et d'utiliser son intelligence pour apprendre � faire fonctionner ses mains ou ce qui en tenait lieu. Si Leigh Brackett (1915-1978) est mondialement connue pour avoir sc�naris� des films aussi c�l�bres que Le Grand sommeil (co�crit avec William Faulkner), Rio Bravo ou encore L'Empire contre-attaque, celle qui fut la compagne d'un des plus grands auteurs de l'�ge d'Or, Edmond Hamilton, demeure avant tout une romanci�re de tout premier plan qui a donn� ses lettres de noblesse � la science fantasy. Elle a de fait influenc� des g�n�rations d'�crivains, au premier rang desquels Michael Moorcock, qui reconna�t chez cette grande dame des litt�ratures de genre l'une de ses inspirations fondatrices.

Boards slightly rubbed, paper along front hinge split, hinge itself holding strongly, pages toned. 1891 Hard Cover. 367 pp. 8vo. Maroon cloth, gilt titles & decoration. One of the first dystopian novels written in the English language. First published in 1890, just three years after Bellamy's classic utopia Looking Backward, this work can be seen as a reaction to Bellamy, as well as to the political climate of the day. It illuminates injustices and social inequalities that exist in civilizations focused on technological progress and the pursuit of wealth. Donnelly was a staunch Populist, and this ideology is evident throughout. Though the novel describes the overthrow of civilization, he states in his preface, ""Neither am I an anarchist: for I paint a dreadful picture of the world-wreck which successful anarchism would produce."" Though it was popular, it was not reissued until Harvard's Belknap Press reprinted it in 1960. Pre-1960 imprints in general, and Schulte editions in particular, are uncommon on the market.

1244701135,0,US$ 567.53,0,0,hardcover,"New York, Harper & Brothers, 1882. 8vo. Orig. Pictorial green full cloth w. gilt spine and gilt centre-piece depicting Poseidon on front board. Gilding on front board a little worn. Corners a bit bumped, capitals a bit worn, spine crooked. Inner front hinge a bit weak. Internally nice and clean. Overall a nice and fine copy. Numerous illustrations throughout. X, 480 pp. Frontispiece, 15 plates consisting in maps of Atlantis and depicting Vesuvius erupting, faces of Mexican people, alphabetic plate, artefacts from the Broze Age etc. First edition of this classic, which is the main work within Atlantis-research and which, although serious and scientific, directly inspired the occultism that has ever since clung to the myth of Atlantis.Ignatius Donnelly (1831-1901) was an American politician, lawyer, land promoter and author, who is now best known for his pioneering work on Atlantis. His ""Atlantis the Antediluvian World"" became an instant best-seller, when it was originally published in 1882, and it has stayed in print ever since, still to this day being the main authority on the legend of Atlantis, due to his thorough handling of the actual facts (which had never been seen before).Donnelly's theory of Atlantis revolves around a number of similarities between different cultures that are widely separated, which for him proved that one central point was the actual origin of all civilization. He takes both linguistic, ethnographical, mythological and physical evidence into account for this thesis. His work is based on interpretations of the actual facts and on a literal interpretation of Plato's account of Atlantis. This work was the first actual and serious account and investigation of the Atlantis myth, and as such it inspired all hysteria around it as well as the vast occultism that ever since surrounded this myth. The work was hugely popular from the time of its appearance; it was reprinted numerous times and still to this day continues to be a classic and somewhat of a bestseller."

Erste deutsche Ausgabe. - "". ein in Amerika 1890 ver�ffentlichtes Buch, das, so phantastisch es ist, einen betr�chtlichen unmittelbaren Erfolg hatte . Donnely wurde in Philadelphia 1831 geboren, zog nach dem Westen und lie� sich schon fr�h in Minnesota nieder, wo er w�hrend des B�rgerkrieges stellvertretender Gouverneur . sowie eine f�hrende Pers�nlichkeit in der People's Party war. Er war . verworren, exzentrisch, aber schlau und ein mutiger und offener Gegner von Bestechung und Monopol . (Unr�hmlichen politischen) Erlebnissen verdankt ""C�sars Denks�ule"" seine Existenz . dramatische Kapitel beschreiben die Laster und die Selbstsucht der Reichen, die Entmenschung und die wachsende Emp�rung der Massen und schlie�lich die wilde Revolte als Teil eines weltumfassenden Aufstandes, in dem die Arbeiter unter F�hrung eines geheimen und h�chst finsteren ""Vernichtungsbundes"" den Kapitalismus und seine Zivilisation zerst�ren. Diese Revolte hat weder Sinn noch Ziel, sie f�hrt lediglich zu einer Orgie von Gemetzeln und Tumulten, welche in der Episode gipfelt, von der das Buch seinen Titel herleitet. So viele Leichname liegen in den Stra�en New Yorks, da� der Anf�hrer . beschlie�t, aus ihnen eine gewaltige S�ule zu errichten. So l��t er abwechselnd eine Schicht Leichen und eine Schicht Zement legen . ""Zur Erinnerung an den Tod und das Begr�bnis der Modernen Zivilisation"" . Voller Entsetzen . flieht Weltstein (Hauptperson der Utopie) zur�ck in seine afrikanische Heimat, einen der wenigen Orte, die von der Katastrophe nicht heimgesucht worden sind. Dort beabsichtigt er den Aufbau einer Republik . ohne Ausbeutung, im Grunde das, was Donelly und seine populistischen Freunde in Amerika w�nschten. "" (Morton, Die englische Utopia 241 ff). - Vgl.

Those of you who have joined me before in these cozy collections of chills and suspense know that in earlier volumes I have explored various unusual fields to bring you exciting and absorbing stories. In the past I have delved into the world of ghosts, haunts and apparitions of various types and differing degrees of spookiness. I have taken you into the shadowy world of the spies and counterspies who are so much a part of our life today. I have picked out my favorite spellbinders in sheer suspense to share with you. We have, in short, adventured into strange and colorful places together. This time, though, we stand firmly on the side of the law. This is a collection of some of my favorite detective stories. In it we shall peer over the shoulders of many of fiction's finest detectives, to track down the malefactor and set wrong to right. We will pick up clues, solve tantalizing mysteries, and unravel riddles that seem impenetrable. I believe you will find this group of stories as exciting, as engrossing, as any I have brought you. Now the game's a-foot and the chase is on! Turn the page and we'll be on our way."" - Alfred Hitchcock."

La dottrina segreta secondo la Blavatsky sarebbe stata, fin dagli albori dell'umanit�, la religione-sapienza universalmente diffusa, sintesi del sapere totale e del mistero della vita. L'autrice inizia lo sviluppo della sua ricerca partendo da un misterioso e antichissimo testo il libro di dzyan scritto su foglie di Palma. Il manoscritto suddiviso in sette stanze espone i vari livelli dell'evoluzione cosmica dali' Origine della coscienza al processo di formazione dei mondi. ""Finch� le conclusioni della cos� detta scienza esatta saranno basate su di un sostrato di fatti inattaccabili, nessun conflitto sar� possibile fra i suoi insegnamenti e quelli della scienza occulta. Solo quando i suoi pi� ardenti interpreti, sorpassando i limiti dei fenomeni osservati e tentando di strappare allo spirito la formazione del Kosmos e delle sue forze viventi, per attribuire tutto alla cieca materia, gli occultisti affermano il diritto di discutere e di mettere in dubbio tali teorie. La scienza non pu�, per causa della natura stessa delle cose, svelare il mistero dell'universo che ci circonda. Essa pu� raggruppare, classificare e generalizzare i fenomeni; ma l'occultista, basando i suoi ragionamenti su dati metafisici ammessi, afferma che l'indagatore che voglia esplorare i segreti pi� intimi della natura deve trascende-dere i limiti dei sensi e trasferire la sua coscienza nella regione del noumeno e nella sfera delle cause primordiali. Egli deve sviluppare Facolt� che, salvo qualche caso eccezionale, sono latenti nella co-istituzione dei discendenti della nostra quinta razza-madre attuale, in Europa ed in America. Egli non pu� raccogliere in nessun altro modo i fatti su cui fondare le sue speculazioni"" H.P.B."

30060666804,Good,US$ 950.00,0,0,hardcover,"A two-volume study by the Scottish Presbyterian cleric and man of letters (1790&#8722;1855). In his preface, Crichton presents his book as a first effort to  connect the past with the illustrations of modern discovery so as to exhibit the whole in moderate compass,  that is, in only two volumes. He acknowledges the ill-informed and prejudicial views that many readers bring to the subject of Islam, and states that he seeks to create a simple chronological narrative. The book covers the pre-Islamic history of Arabia, the mission of Muhammad in the seventh century, the Arab conquests of North Africa and Spain, and the history of the Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad. Separate chapters are devoted to Arabic literature, the civil history and government of the Arabs, the Hejaz, the hajj, and the Wahabi sect and the Wahhabi wars of the 18th and early 19th centuries. The chapter on the Qur an is remarkable for its time. In covering the early Islamic conquests and the fragmentation of the Umayyad and Abbasid empires, the narrative is mainly declarative, and thus in keeping with the author s stated goal of objectivity. Crichton gives credit to and at times evaluates his sources. In the case of the Wahhabi wars, for example, he compares sources and ranks the writings of Jacob Burkhardt (1818&#8722;97) and Louis Alexandre Olivier de Corancez (1770&#8722;1832) higher than those of other authors. The book contains nine unattributed illustrations and a detailed map of the Arabian Peninsula and the Syrian Desert engraved by G.B. King. Ships from U.A.E."

The fact that the story of Atlantis was for thousands of years regarded as a fable proves nothing. There is an unbelief which grows out of ignorance, as well as a scepticism which is born of intelligence. The people nearest to the past are not always those who are best informed concerning the past. For a thousand years it was believed that the legends of the buried cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were myths: they were spoken of as ""the fabulous cities."" For a thousand years the educated world did not credit the accounts given by Herodotus of the wonders of the ancient civilizations of the Nile and of Chaldea. He was called ""the father of liars."" Even Plutarch sneered at him. Now, in the language of Frederick Schlegel, ""the deeper and more comprehensive the researches of the moderns have been, the more their regard and esteem for Herodotus has increased."" Buckle says, ""His minute information about Egypt and Asia Minor is admitted by all geographers."" There was a time when the expedition sent out by Pharaoh Necho to circumnavigate Africa was doubted, because the explorers stated that after they had progressed a certain distance the sun was north of them; this circumstance, which then aroused suspicion, now proves to us that the Egyptian navigators had really passed the equator, and anticipated by 2100 years Vasquez de Gama in his discovery of the Cape of Good Hope. If I succeed in demonstrating the truth of the somewhat startling propositions with which I commenced this chapter, it will only be by bringing to bear upon the question of Atlantis a thousand converging lines of light from a multitude of researches made by scholars in different fields of modern thought. Further investigations and discoveries will, I trust, confirm the correctness of the conclusions at which I have arrived."

Brought forth out of the fertile imagination of Leigh Brackett, Stark again returns to face new dangers, his mighty sword ever ready to fight for a just cause. Stark had killed the king-dog Flay on the plains of Worldheart. Now he was the leader of the ferocious Northhounds--nine great white beasts that responded to his every command. But should they ever turn on him, the hounds could prove more deadly than any enemy on that hostile planet. Stark had to reach the starport---before the treacherous Wandsmen closed his only means of escape! [Ballantine #24230]. . Mass Market Paperback. 12mo - over 6�"" - 7�"" tall."

After nearly 4500 years it still intrigues modern readers with its imaginative insights into the universal human condition and the desire for a blissful afterlife. Entombed with this book of rituals, the deceased had a detailed guide for the nightly journey with the sun through the dark and dangerous underworld, providing a guarantee of resurrection in the afterlife at dawn. Originally it was usually written on a papyrus scroll which was sent with the prepared body in its coffin or burial chamber. Included are spells, hymns and instructions for the dead to pass through obstacles in the afterlife. The Book of the Dead was first thought to be a Bible but is it not a religious work. It is more of an instruction manual for the recently departed. We discover in the Book of the Dead a commonly shared humanity that reaches out to us across more than four thousand years with timeless and universal expressions of hopes and fears that are sometimes quite familiar, sometimes quite strange."

He took pleasure in his turn of good luck until he discovered his new body was hated by all on Venus and his soul was owned by Rann. The Star-Mouse - Fredric Brown. Robinson Crusoe.Gulliver - the story of their adventures is nothing compared to the Saga of Mitkey Mouse. Return of a Legend - Raymond Z. Gallun. Mars fever they called it. Could the wild boy cheat the Red Planet's deserts and the grim pursuit by the Terrans? Quest of Thig - Basil Wells. Thig of Orthas was the vanguard of the conquering ""Horde"". He had blasted across trackless space to subdue a defenseless world - only to find on Earth something more deadly than weapons. The Rocketeers Have Shaggy Ears - Keith Bennett. Some day there will be a legend like this. Some day from steamy Venus or arid Mars word will come back of the glorious deeds of the heroic Men of Terra! The Diversifal - Ross Rocklynne. Side by side they would live, year after year, hating each other more fiercely each day. Duel on Syrtis - Poul Anderson. Bold and ruthless, he was famed throughout the System as a big-game hunter. But Riordan's trophy room lacked one item.a Martian! PLANET STORIES 1939-1955. During the golden age of the pulps - those fabulous magazines featuring larger-than-life heroes battling monstrous aliens on hostile planets or pursuing the luscious goddesses of golden worlds - some 70 issues of Planet Stories were published. When the magazine folded, along with most of the other pulps, the space opera all but disappeared. Gone were those marvelous stories that drew us out beyond our narrow skies into the vastness of interstellar space where a billion nameless planets might harbor life forms infinitely numerous and strange. Now Leigh Brackett - whose thrilling tales of wonder and high adventure filled the pages of Planet - has selected seven of the most dazzling stories ever published in that magazine.

FROM THE PUBLISHER - From the introduction by John Malcolm Brinnin:  Emily Dickinson s legend does not conveniently accommodate the out-size  Empress of Calvary  whose suffering goads her to defy the very God her deeper nature wants only to praise. Neither does it find room for the defeated woman who, with careful malevolence, undermines the divine optimism that promises her only salvation. In this role she is never the pretty versifier or the sprightly caroller of the New Enqland idyll or even the long-suffering communicant with nature. In this role she is the daemonic artist in fury, wrenching the tight metres and neat figures of her characteristic language in order to come upon utterance adequate to her anguish. . inventory #41613 Tear to Back Cover, Otherwise Good in Slightly Worn Wrappers."

A sensational work published in 1877, a compendium of world culture and belief systems and surely an insightful read for anyone interested in the esoteric world of ancient and contemporary sciences.Isis Unveiled, written by the young Russian H.P.Blavatsky (founder of The Theosophical Society), explores the mysteries of ancient and modern science and theology.It describes the history, purpose and development of the occult sciences; the nature and origins of magic, the roots of Christianity, the errors of Christian dogmatism and the erroneous beliefs of orthodox science; it represents the summa of the doctrine of Blavatsky and guides the reader towards a form of ""integral"" knowledge that draws on different sources: from Christianity to the cabal, from the Pythagorean school to Buddhism, from Brahamanism to spiritualism.Isis Unveiled is therefore a work of universal significance that collects suggestions, information and teachings from the culture of peoples around the world, providing an invaluable contribution to truth and knowledge."

For almost a century and a half, Bulfinch's Mythology has been the text by which the great tales of the gods and goddesses, Greek and Roman antiquity, Scandinavian, Celtic, and Oriental fables and myths, and the age of chivalry have been known. The forerunner of such interpreters as Edith Hamilton and Robert Graves, Thomas Bulfinch wanted to make these stories available to the general reader. A series of private notes to himself grew into one of the single most useful and concise guides to literature and mythology. The stories are divided into three sections: The Age of Fable or Stories of Gods and Heroes (first published in 1855); The Age of Chivalry (1858), which contains King Arthur and His Knights, The Mabinogeon, and The Knights of English History; and The Legends of Charlemagne or The Romance of the Middle Ages (1863). For the Greek myths, Bulfinch drew on Ovid and Virgil, and for the sagas of the north, from Mallet's Northern Antiquities. provides lively versions of the myths of Zeus and Hera, Venus and Adonis, Daphne and Apollo, and their cohorts on Mount Olympus; the love story of Pygmalion and Galatea; the legends of the Trojan War and the epic wanderings of Ulysses and Aeneas; the joys of Valhalla and the furies of Thor; and the tales of Beowulf and Robin Hood.

The legends of a fabled land of the lost have floated for centuries around the bazaars of North Africa and the sand-surrounded oases of the vast Sahara. They tell of treasure caravans that have never returned, of weird monsters forgotten by time, of savage peoples surviving out of antiquity. Eric Carstairs had heard these tales but until he met Professor Potter he did not really believe them. But the famous paleontologist had the location of the entrance to the Underground World pinned down, and wanted only a man of courage to fly him there. Carstairs and Potter took the chance-and pierced the pit to Zanthodon, a world within the world, where cavemen and cave-beasts roamed side by side with dinosaur-monsters of millions of years ago. Lin Carter launches a new series of adventures that will rank with his Green Star and Callisto books- and will delight the millions who have yearned for the road to Pellucidar!

A valuable and lively account of the Duke of Marlborough's campaigns by a senior Scottish soldier who was wounded at the Battle of Blenheim.

His papers were cast aside after his death and lay neglected for years until they were sold to a local tobacconist who saved them from destruction.

A sensational work published in 1877, a compendium of world culture and belief systems and surely an insightful read for anyone interested in the esoteric world of ancient and contemporary sciences.Isis Unveiled, written by the young Russian H.P.Blavatsky (founder of The Theosophical Society), explores the mysteries of ancient and modern science and theology.It describes the history, purpose and development of the occult sciences; the nature and origins of magic, the roots of Christianity, the errors of Christian dogmatism and the erroneous beliefs of orthodox science; it represents the summa of the doctrine of Blavatsky and guides the reader towards a form of ""integral"" knowledge that draws on different sources: from Christianity to the cabal, from the Pythagorean school to Buddhism, from Brahamanism to spiritualism.Isis Unveiled is therefore a work of universal significance that collects suggestions, information and teachings from the culture of peoples around the world, providing an invaluable contribution to truth and knowledge."

The welcome which has been accorded to the volumes of this Series, and the fact that some of them have passed into second and third editions, suggest that these little books have been found useful by beginners in Egyptology and others. Hitherto the object of them has been to supply information about the Religion, Magic, Language, and History of the ancient Egyptians, and to provide editions of the original texts from which such information was derived. There are, however, many branches of Egyptology which need treatment in a similar manner in this Series, and it has been suggested in many quarters that the time has now arrived when the publication of a series of groups of texts illustrating Egyptian Literature in general might well be begun. Seeing that nothing is known about the authors of Egyptian works, not even their names, it is impossible to write a History of Egyptian Literature in the ordinary sense of the word. The only thing to be done is to print the actual works in the best and most complete form possible, with translations, and then to put them in the hands of the reader and leave them to his judgment. With this object in view, it has been decided to publish in the Series several volumes which shall be devoted to the reproduction in hieroglyphic type of the best and most typical examples of the various kinds of Egyptian Literature, with English translations, on a much larger scale than was possible in my ""First Steps in Egyptian"" or in my ""Egyptian Reading Book."" These volumes are intended to serve a double purpose, i.e., to supply the beginner in Egyptian with new material and a series of reading books, and to provide the general reader with translations of Egyptian works in a handy form."

Un'opera pubblicata nel 1877, un compendio della cultura mondiale e sicuramente una lettura approfondita per chiunque sia interessato al mondo esoterico delle scienze antiche e contemporanee. ""Iside svelata"", scritto dalla giovane russa H.P. Blavatsky (fondatrice della Societ� Teosofica), esplora i misteri della scienza e della teologia antiche e moderne. Descrive la storia, lo scopo e lo sviluppo delle scienze occulte; la natura e le origini della magia, le radici del cristianesimo, gli errori del dogmatismo cristiano e le credenze erronee della scienza ortodossa; rappresenta la summa della dottrina di Blavatsky e guida il lettore verso una forma di conoscenza integrale che attinge a fonti diverse: dal cristianesimo alla cabala, dalla scuola pitagorica al buddismo, dal brahmanesimo allo spiritismo.

""Sir Ernest Alfred Thompson Wallis Budge (27 July 1857   23 November 1934) was an English Egyptologist, Orientalist, and philologist who worked for the British Museum and published numerous works on the ancient Near East. He made numerous trips to Egypt and the Sudan on behalf of the British Museum to buy antiquities, and helped it build its collection of cuneiform tablets, manuscripts, and papyri. He published many books on Egyptology, helping to bring the findings to larger audiences. In 1920, he was knighted for his service to Egyptology and the British Museum. "" (from Wikipedia)."

Several original stories were published, stories which had been purchased by the US version of Super Science Stories before its demise in 1943. These original stories were later reprinted in the US Super Science Stories upon its resurrection in 1949. The cover art for this Canadian pulp magazine was generally re-painted versions of the US pulp. The stories in this issue were earlier published in the US Super Science Stories, and there are no original stories.

On this Island of Atlantis, it is held, man first rose from a state of barbarism to civilization. From the mighty nation that developed there, colonizing parties went out to the Gulf of Mexico, the Mississippi, the Amazon, the Pacific Coast of South America, the Mediterranean, the West coast of Europe and Africa, the Baltic and the Middle East. ***Donnelly's Atlantis was originally published in 1882. Its success was immediate and world-wide and it still stands as the cornerstone on which all modern study of the ""lost continent"" depends. The literature of Atlantis comprising some five thousand works in twenty different languages, has, for the last sixty years, followed the trail that Donnelly blazed. Not one of them has matched the popularity of this work. This edition also contains appreciations of Donnelly by Lewis spence and H.S. Bellamy and a short note by Paul le Cour.'

A young German-Jewish dentist, Gustav Adolph Danziger, had brought him a rough translation of a short novel by Richard Voss, Der M�nch von Berchtesgaden, which had appeared in a German monthly. Bierce rewrote the story from Danziger's translation, and the two signed a complicated contract dividing the rewards they expected to get. Their work appeared serially under the title The Monk and the Hangman's Daughter in the Examiner; then it was published by F. J. Schulte of Chicago, who went bankrupt. For years Danziger squabbled with Bierce over The Monk and the Hangman's Daughter"" (M. E.

The great metropolis dazzles with its futuristic technology, but its ostentatious wealth and luxury mask the brutal repression of the laboring classes by their rich bosses. The workers, aided by international terrorists [!], stage a violent revolt and the narrator flees the devastated city by airship to found an agrarian utopia in Africa. Fueled by outrage at social conditions, Caesar's Column was the first major dystopian novel in the English language. Its author, Ignatius Donnelly, was the most famous-and controversial-American populist politician of the day, and his book became a huge bestseller. --Wesleyan University Press ; ""An apocalyptic vision conceived in urgency and despair by one of the most fascinating mavericks in American political history, the novel accords more closely with the anxious temper of our own times than other anticipatory works that emerged from the same historical moment. For all its faults, Caesar's Column remains surprisingly readable, even gripping, today. It is a milestone in the formative stage of modern science fiction.""--Nicholas Ruddick ; G."
